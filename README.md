# StarfableIO

StarfableIO is a blog and tutorial website written in [Astro.js](https://astro.build/), focusing on providing engaging and educational content.

## Features

- **Astro.js** for fast and modern web development
- **Cypress** for end-to-end testing
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code, deploying to AWS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20.17.0+)
- npm (v10.8.2+)
- Terraform (v1.9.7+)
- rustc (v1.80.0+)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HtetLinMaung/starfableio.git
cd starfableio
npm install
```

## Running in Development

To start the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and watches for file changes.

## Building for Production

To build the project for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of Astro.js website, ready for deployment.

## End-to-End Testing

To run Cypress tests:

```bash
npm run cy:open
```

This will open the Cypress test runner for running end-to-end tests. You can add new tests under the cypress/e2e folder.

Example simple test written in TypeScript:

```ts
describe("Homepage Test", () => {
  it("should visit the homepage", () => {
    cy.visit("/");
    cy.contains("Welcome to StarfableIO");
  });
});
```

## Deploying with Terraform

After building the project, you can deploy it to AWS using Terraform:

1. Navigate to the infrastructure folder:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform (only needed the first time or when updating providers/backends):

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Apply the Terraform plan to deploy:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

Make sure your AWS credentials are properly configured.
